// Original type representing a person with required properties
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

// Mapped type making all properties of Person optional
type PartialPerson = {
  [P in keyof Person]?: Person[P];
};

// Usage example
const partialPerson: PartialPerson = {};
// partialPerson can have properties name?: string and age?: number


in above code i have understood everything but below portion of code i don't understood please explain in more easy and different way
type PartialPerson = {
  [P in keyof Person]?: Person[P];
};


---------------------------answer-----------------
Certainly! In the line of code:

```typescript
type PartialPerson = {
  [P in keyof Person]?: Person[P];
};
```

Here's a more straightforward breakdown:

1. `keyof Person`: This part fetches all keys (properties) of the `Person` type. In this case, it gets `"name"` and `"age"`.

2. `[P in keyof Person]?: Person[P];`: This part creates a new type (`PartialPerson`). It uses a mapped type to iterate over each key (`P`) in the `Person` type.

    - `Person[P]`: This part retrieves the type of the property `P` from the original `Person` type. For example, if `P` is `"name"`, `Person[P]` is `string`; if `P` is `"age"`, `Person[P]` is `number`.

    - `[P in keyof Person]?`: The `?` makes each property in `PartialPerson` optional. It means that properties in `PartialPerson` can either be of the same type as the original `Person` or `undefined`.

Putting it all together, `PartialPerson` is a new type that has the same properties as `Person`, but each property is optional (can be `undefined`). This allows you to create objects where some properties might be missing.

So, for the example:

```typescript
const partialPerson: PartialPerson = {};
```

`partialPerson` is an object that can have properties like `"name"` (with a string value) or `"age"` (with a number value), or it can be completely empty (`{}`). It's a way to define a type that represents partially filled objects based on another type.
