// Type inference in TypeScript refers to the ability of the Typescript compilers to automatically determine and assign types to variables, expressions, and functions return values based on their usage and context in the code.

let myName = "baboo";
let myFavNum = 1010;
let firstName = "Baboo";
let age = 24;
let is_valid = true;

/* 
Use type interference for simple cases where the assigned value clearly indicates the intended types.
? When in doubt, provide explicit type annotations to make your intentions clear.
Avoid relying too heavily on type inference when the assigned value is complex
or ambigious.
Regulay review and refactor your code to ensure the inferred types align with your intenwions
